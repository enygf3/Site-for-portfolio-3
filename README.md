# Site-for-portfolio

if you want to see this site, paste "enygf2.github.io" into a browser adress bar. The site have a problem with scroll. If you will click on any item in navbar you will see appropriate block.
And here is the problem. If i click, for example, on 3 item third block will get class "active" and i will see this block. But. The scroll will start on first block instead of
third and i don't know how to fix it. If you know, please make a pull request

Note: Mobile version isn't done yet.
